* Java
1. Currently we have both proto generated and custom implementations for Instance and Command;
   We transform from custom implementation to proto generated one. Refactor such that we have only proto generated classes.

* C++

  - consider replacing ballot with atomic and using the CAS loop, and make sure
    to insert PAUSEs below, per recommendation of Thiago on C++ slack.

  - The current design may push stale prepare responses to prepare_ok_reponses
    and increase the prepare_num_responses. Then the prepare_thread proceed to
    replay as it reaches prepare_num_responses, though the instances for replay
    are not from majority peers. (heartbeat_thread and accept might have similar
    issues, though it seems that they won't fail the correctness so far)
