- first, do synchronous gRPC.

- currently, replicant hangs on accept() and we stop the program using C-c. this
  has further implications because, e.g., a standalone heartbeat thread willl
  not be able to know when to stop; this is not a problem because the OS will
  clean up if we C-c and exit the main thread, but a cleaner solution is
  desirable.

- handle errors in asio calls -- or at least add assertions.

- change cmake to look for asio.
