== TYPES =======================================================================

- struct command_t
  - synopsis: a key-value command
  - fields:
    - type: enum {get, put, del}
    - key: string
    - value: string (valid only for put type)
  - init: N/A (fields set upon construction)

- struct instance_t
  - synopsis: entry in the log.
  - fields:
    - round: the round number
    - command: command_t
    - index: index of the command in the log.
    - state: enum {in-progress, committed}
  - init:
    - round: provided during construction
    - command: provided during construction
    - index: provided during construction
    - state: in-progress
  - description: each instance starts in the in-progress state, and changes to
    the committed state once quorum has voted for it.

== THREADS ACTING ON A PAXOS OBJECT ============================================

- main threads: the entry point of the paxos object is the agree_and_execute
  method. for each incoming command, this method is called in a separate thread.
  hence, at any given time, we may have multiple concurrent threads running
  agree_and_execute method. we call these main threads.

- heartbeat thread: a paxos object runs a heartbeat thread. there is just one
  such thread. we call it the heartbeat thread.

- request threads: agree_and_execute calls RPCs on peers for phase1 and phase2.
  we are currently using blocking RPC calls; therefore, each of these calls are
  made in a separate thread. we call these request threads.

- handler threads: the RPC handlers run in threads managed by gRPC runtime. we
  call these handler threads.

== PAXOS OBJECT STATE VARIABLES ================================================

- peers_
  - synopsis: an array of RPC endpoints to the peers
  - init: constructed based on the configuration file
  - description: this array is constructed on startup and read when sending
    phase1, phase2, and heartbeat messages to the peers.
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: agree_and_execute reads peers_ during phase1 and phase2.
    - heartbeat thread: reads peers_ when sending heartbeat messages.
  - writing threads:
    - none
  - notes: for now, this array is constructed once at the beginning, and from
    there on it is only read from. no need to protect it with a mutex until we
    start supporting reconfiguration.

- log_
  - synopsis: an array of instance_t's.
  - init: empty
  - description: during phase2, instances are appended to log_'s head and they
    are gradually pruned from its tail.
  - reading threads:
  - writing threads:
    - main threads: agree_and_execute calls phase2, which ends up inserting a
      new entry into log_ and then possibly updating the entry's status.

- head_
  - synopsis: index of the last command in the log_.
  - init: 0
  - description: used for determining the index of a new command. a new command
    is assigned the index of ++head_.
  - reading threads:
  - writing threads:
    - main threads: agree_and_execute increments head_

- tail_
  - synopsis: index of the last executed command in the log_.
  - init: 0
  - description: once a command is committed, it is safe to execute it on the
    state machine if all the preceding commands are committed and executed.
    hence, every time a command is committed, if its index is equal to tail_ +
    1, then that command is executed and tail_ is incremented.
  - writing threads:
    - main threads: phase2, if successful, executes the command and increments
      tail_.
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: read tail_ to see if it reached index-1.
    - heartbeat thread: heartbeat thread reads tail_ after it has received all
      RPC responses to compute the new min_tail_.
    - request threads: phase1 reads tail_ when sending out prepare message.
    - handler threads: heartbeat handler reads tail_ to respond to heartbeat.

- tail_cv_ and tail_mu_: a condition variable and a mutex for tail_.

- min_tail_
  - synopsis: minimum of tails of all peers.
  - init: 0
  - description: helps with pruning logs. all the commands with indices <=
    min_tail can be safely pruned from all peers' logs since these commands have
    been applied to the state machine of every peer. this variable is updated
    through heartbeats. as a response to a heartbeat, the leader receives tail_
    from all peers, computes the min_tail_, and then in the next heartbeat sends
    it to the followers. the leader should send an updated min_tail_ only if it
    has received tails from all the peers. Otherwise, liveness will be violated
    as described in SCENARIO-1.
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: currently, we are not doing anything with it, but the main
      thread, after executing a command, may want to read and prune all the
      entries before and including min_tail_.
  - writing threads:
    - heartbeat thread: after the heartbeat thread receives all the tails from
      peers, it computes the new value for min_tail_ and updates it.
    - handler threads: the heartbeat handler, after receiving the new min_tail_
      value, updates its copy of min_tail_.

- leader_
  - synopsis: a boolean indicating if a peer is a leader.
  - init: false
  - description: true if this peer is a leader and false otherwise.
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: agree_and_execute reads leader_ to decide how to act.
  - writing threads:
    - main threads: phase1 sets leader_ to true if successful.
    - request threads: when in response to an RPC request, we receive a response
      that contains a higher round, we set leader_ to false and current_leader_
      to the id of the responder.
    - response threads: when an RPC request contains a higher round, we set
      leader_ to false and current_leader_ to the id of the requester.

- ready_
  - synopsis: a boolean indicating if the leader is ready to accept commands:
  - init: false
  - description: true if this peer is leader and it is ready to accept commands
  - reading threads:
    - main thread: agree_and_execute reads ready_ to decide if it can accept commands
  - writing threads:
    - phase1 thread:

- current_leader_
  - synopsis: id of the current leader
  - init: null
  - description: with the exception of startup, when all peers are followers, at
    any point in time, either current_leader_ is null and leader_ is true or
    current_leader_ is non-null and leader_ is false.
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: agree_and_execute and phase2 both read current_leader_.
  - writing threads:
    - request threads: when in response to an RPC request, we receive a response
      that contains a higher round, we set leader_ to false and current_leader_
      to the id of the responder.
    - response threads: when an RPC request contains a higher round, we set
      leader_ to false and current_leader_ to the id of the requester.

- last_heartbeat_
  - synopsis: time of the last heartbeat from current leader.
  - init: 0
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: agree_and_execute reads last_heartbeat_ to determine if the
      current leader is alive.
  - writing threads:
    - handler threads: heartbeat handler sets last_heartbeat_ every time.

- heartbeat_interval_
  - synopsis: time between heartbeats.
  - init: 300ms
  - reading threads: N/A
  - writing threads: N/A

- id_
  - synopsis: an integer representing the id of the peer
  - init: passed in as a command-line argument
  - reading threads: N/A
  - writing threads: N/A

- round_
  - synopsis: an integer representing the current paxos round.
  - init: 0
  - description: also known as ballot or term, this number represents the
    current round known to peer, during which this or some other peer is the
    leader. it is incremented when a peer needs to start phase1 (leader
    election) and sent to other peers as phase1a message with the id_ used as
    the lower bits, acting as a uniqueifier.
  - reading threads:
    - main threads: proposal() reads round_ to form the current proposal number.
  - writing threads:
    - main threads: next_proposal() increments round_.

- handle duplicates

how do we elect a leader?

by default hb handler is like this:

assert(current_leader__exists_ && message_received_from_current_leader_)
update last_heard_from_leader
update last_min_executed

if hb handler needs to establish leadership, then the handler is like this:

it is possible that we receive a message when there is no leader, and it is
possible that we receive a message when there is already a leader

if no-current-leader:
  set_current_leader_
// this handles both cases: preexisting leader
passert(current_leader__exists_ && message_received_from_current_leader_)
update last_heard_from_leader
update last_min_executed

(TODO: imagine a scenario that there is a gap in the log, like [a, b, _, d] and
once the thread1 commits d, it starts to wait until command at index 2 is
executed and thread1 is woken up. at that moment, this machine stops being a
leader, and someone else starts to run. they receive the log state, and
eventually, they determine what goes into 2, and eventually, they notify this
peer about the state of the log. then, we should wake up thread1)

== SCENARIOS ===================================================================

SCENARIO-1: Consider peers A, B, C, D, E, where A is the leader, and all peers
have synchronized logs with last_executed = 10. The peer E experiences a
partition, and in the meantime, A, B, C, D commit a lot more commands and each
increase their last_executed to 15, 14, 13, 14, respectively, whereas E's
last_executed remains at 10. A, the leader, receives last_executed from just B,
C, and D, and sends 13 as the min_last_executed back to peers, and A, B, C, and
D prune the commands up to and including 13. In the meantime, a client contacts
E, which at this point thinks (due to partition) that A is dead. So E increments
proposal# and starts phase1, times out, and keeps retrying phase1, with higher
and higher proposal#. At some point, the partition is fixed, and E sends
proposal# higher than A's current proposal# and asks for the log entries
starting at 11; but none of the peers has these entries, and the cluster is
stuck: the peers do not have the log entries so they cannot reply, and E will
just keep retrying phase1 with higher proposal#.

== SCRATCH SPACE ===============================================================

how does leader election work in raft? the heartbeat thread regularly checks if
it has received a heartbeat from the leader. if it has, then it does nothing. if
it hasn't, then it sleeps for a random amount of time and starts leader election
by asking for a vote from everyone. if someone receives a vote with a term
higher than the its own, they immediately downgrade to a follower. furthermore,
each follower votes only once in a term.
